# semantic-word-segmentation

<p class=lead>Usually when writing a comment, review or veratim, we're most likely to commit a typo unintentinnaly. For example :
instead of writing <b>"Tres bon service"</b>, one might write sudenlly <b>"Tres bonservice"</b>. So when doing feature engineering with BOW or TFIDF, the algorithm will consider that <b>bonservice</b> as a unique token, while it is not. <br>To deal with this problem we build a module dealing with semantic word segmentation.</p>
